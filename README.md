# Health_Insurance_Database_Management_System

Having Health Insurance is absolutely essential as it helps 
you manage your health care needs as well as the costs 
associated with it which come in handy in case of medical 
emergencies.

It pays the costs for medical care that you or the covered 
dependents receive. Without it, you might need to pay the 
entire cost of your medical care which gets difficult during 
emergencies.

Insurance Companies face one problem which is keeping 
track of valuable information such as policy holder’s info, 
records of different types of policies and plans, payment 
records, etc. This problem in the long run can cause 
problems not only for the policyholders but for the Insurance 
Company as well.

This project aims to solve that problem by building an efficient Data Base 
Management System for Health Insurance Companies.

I have built an application that takes in the policyholder’s info as input and 
automatically stores it in the main database at the same time ensuring that 
no policyholder’s information is lost and no mixing of information with other 
policyholders takes place.
This application also plots an Insurance Policy Plan 
distribution based on policyholder claims in the form of a pie 
chart which gives information to the insurance company 
about the most preferred plan by the policyholders and make 
strategies accordingly.
